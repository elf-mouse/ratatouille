# 01 Set Up Your Editor

**TL;DR**

- Choose an editor that lets you customize shortcuts and has lots of plugins to help you write better code.
- Make use of the package manager to make it easier to discover, install, and update plugins.
- Install plugins that help keep you productive during development; start with the recommendations in this guide.

## Install [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) Text Editor

**Note** Rob Dodson’s [blog post](http://robdodson.me/blog/2012/06/23/sublime-text-2-tips-and-shortcuts/) on how to get to know and love Sublime is a great reference for getting the most out of your editor. The concepts are relevant to any text editor, not just Sublime.

## Why Use a [Package Manager](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation)?

Package managers make it easy to find, install, and keep packages & plugins up-to-date.

## Install Plugins

Package managers make it very easy to find, install, and update plugins:

1. In the Sublime Text editor, open your package manager (`ctrl+shift+p`).
2. Enter ‘Install Package’.
3. Enter the name of the plugin you are looking for (or else browse all plugins).
