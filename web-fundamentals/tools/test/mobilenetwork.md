# 01 Test Against Mobile Network Conditions

If you're running **Google Chrome**, you can use the [Network Conditioning](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/device-mode#network-conditions) feature offered by the DevTools.

If you're on a **Mac**, try out the Network Link Conditioner tool found in the Lion Developer Tools.

This can be installed by doing the following:

1. Open Xcode
2. Select the following from the menu: `XCode > Open Developer Tool > More Developer Tools`
3. When the Apple Developer site opens, go to `Hardware IO Tools for Xcode` and download the Network Link Conditioner dmg file.
4. Once the dmg is downloaded, double click the file and then select the Network Link Conditioner.prefpane and select `Install` on the System Preferences window.

On **Windows**, options also include [Fiddler](http://www.telerik.com/fiddler) and [Charles](http://www.charlesproxy.com/), an HTTP proxy which can throttle your connection speeds.
