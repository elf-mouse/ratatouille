# 07 Asymmetric Animation Timing

__TL;DR__

* Use asymmetric animation timing to add personality and contrast to your work.
* Always favor the user's interaction; use shorter durations when responding to taps or clicks, and reserve slower durations for times where you aren't.

The general rule of thumb, then, is:

* For UI animations triggered by a userâ€™s interaction, such as view transitions or showing an element, have a fast intro (short duration), but a slow outro (longer duration).
* For UI animations triggered by your code, such as errors or modal views, have a slower intro (longer duration), but a fast outro (short duration).
