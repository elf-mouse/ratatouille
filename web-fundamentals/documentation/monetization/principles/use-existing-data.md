# 11 Use existing information to maximize convenience

Take advantage of information you already have, and/or use third-party payment services to make conversion as easy as possible.

For your registered users, remember and pre-fill their preferences. For new users, offer a third-party checkout service they may already use. Several retail sites in the study offered third-party payment services as an option, reducing purchasing friction for users of those services and allowing the site to prefill shipping info.
